/*****************************************************
*  NEW FEATURES
*****************************************************/
[/] Add validation to fields & loops.
[/] Add a way to reuse models, loops, and fields throughout the config args.
[/] Add a way to reuse an INSTANCE of a model, field, or loop, so that things like ID fields can be used multiple places w/o breaking the seed.
[/] An order property can be added to
[/] Add a flag on fields to allow them to not be returned after generate.
    - Ie, we might have a field used to create other fields, but not want it actually returned after generate is called.
    - Eg, if I have a 'sentDate' and an 'eventDate', I may want a random number that dictates the number of days between sent and event.

/*****************************************************
*  REFACTORS
*****************************************************/
[ ] Replace 'number' and 'string' with a single field called "static." Having these broken down by type is overkill.
[ ] Either declare a dependency on underscore js, or organize some sort of "pseudo-underscore" (like Angular jQuery Lite).
[ ] Make population of the 'fields' and 'loops' enum dynamic.
[ ] Fix up the 'getVariable' method to include better checking (sub-methods?) and a base-case for when a field is not found.
[ ] Consider removing LOOP and MODEL from the 'fields' enum. Would need to find a better way to achieve this, though.
[ ] Change 'random' to 'randomNumber'.
[ ] Hook up grunt to strip out the __testing__ variable on "build."
[ ] Either split the clone method into shallow & deep copy versions, or add a flag parameter to indicate which.



/*****************************************************
*  NEW FIELD TYPES
*****************************************************/
[ ] Random set (ie, pick a random object from a set).
[ ] Guid (or some kind of pseudo guid).
[ ] Random number of a particular length. (eg, a 7-digit token number.)
[ ] Lorem Ipsum.
[ ] Names. (First, Last, Middle or Middle Initial?)
[ ] Address. (This would essentially be either a model, or a set of fields that comprise an address.)
[ ] Phone Number
[ ] SSN
[ ] Credit Card Number?
